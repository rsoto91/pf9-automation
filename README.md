# pf9-automation

Welcome to the platform9-automation repository! This repository provides some useful scripts aimed at simplifying and automating the provisioning of Platform9 Managed Kubernetes (PMK) nodes and Platform9 Managed OpenStack (PMO) hosts. When setting up a VM or a bare-metal instance using Ironic, the cloud-init scripts allow for automatic provisioning of these servers to function as either PMO or PMK nodes seamlessly and making the provisioning rocess seamless and efficient.
